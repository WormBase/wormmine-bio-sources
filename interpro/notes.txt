* schema won't work as it is with DBConverter code.  Could write an SQL script to move
data into more consistently named schema.

* MATCH_STATUS - only take matches where there is a MATCH_STATUS with value 'T'

* STRUCT_CLASS - links to PDB and other known/predicted structure databases.  Could get links
from here when we have more structure data.
