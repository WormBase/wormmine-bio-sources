entrez-organism is a source that operates in two steps.  It first queries the
ObjectStore to find the NCBI taxony identifiers of all Organism objects.  It
then queries the NCBI taxony server to find the full species and genus of the
organism and then updates the Organism objects with that information.  All
InterMine sources use taxon ID to identify organism.
