    <name>2Fe-2S</name>
    <description>Protein which contains at least one 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster: 2 iron
atoms complexed to 2 inorganic sulfides and 4 sulfur atoms of
cysteines from the protein.</description>

  <name>Cataract</name>
    <description>Protein which, if defective, causes cataract, a partial or complete
ocular opacity that affects the crystalline lens or its capsule,
leading to impaired vision or blindness. The many types of cataract
are classified by their morphology (size, shape, location) or
etiology (cause and time of occurrence). Cataracts may occur as an
isolated anomaly, as part of generalized ocular developmental defects,
or as a component of a multisystem disorder.</description>

    <name>Viral immune evasion</name>
    <name>Immunoevasin</name>
    <description>Viral protein involved in host immune evasion thereby optimizing viral
growth and dissemination. Viral immune evasion strategies are typical
of viruses which persist in their host throughout life. For example:
Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae and Retroviridae have
developed subversions of the MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway.
In order to reduce the effectiveness of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
immunity, they express proteins that either down-modulate MHC class I
expression (degradation or mislocalization) or interfere with the
antigen binding/presentation process (down-regulation of the expression
of the transporter associated with antigen processing TAP). Some
proteins of these virus families also down-regulate other molecules
involved in immune recognition.</description>

    <name>Congenital disorder of glycosylation</name>
    <description>Protein which, if defective, causes a congenital disorder of
glycosilation. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes, N-
linked glycans are first assembled on the lipid carrier dolichyl
pyrophosphate. The GlcNAc(2)Man(9)Glc(3) oligosaccharide is
transferred to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides.
Defects along the biosynthetic pathway of N-glycans are associated
with severe multisystemic syndromes called congenital disorders of
glycosylation (CDG). The characteristic biochemical feature of CDG is
defective glycosylation of glycoproteins due to mutations in genes
required for the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. Defects of
the assembly of dolichyl-linked oligosaccharides or their transfer on
to nascent glycoproteins form type I forms of CDG, whereas CDG type II
comprises all defects of the trimming and elongation of N-linked
oligosaccharides.</description>

    <name>Leber congenital amaurosis</name>
    <description>Protein which, if defective, causes Leber congenital amaurosis, a
clinically and genetically heterogeneous type of blindness transmitted
as an autosomal recessive trait and occurring at or shortly after
birth. It is associated with an atypical form of diffuse pigmentation
and commonly with optic atrophy and attenuation of the retinal
vessels.</description>

    <name>Phosphorelay system</name>
    <name>Phospho-relay system</name>
    <name>Two-component sensory transduction system</name>
    <name>Two-component signal transduction system</name>
    <description>Protein involved in a system responding to environmental changes
characterized usually by a sensor kinase in the cell membrane that
phosphorylates itself in response to a signal and a response regulator
to which the phosphoryl group is transferred. The responder is
typically a DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription. Several
of these systems are quite complex, involving many proteins in a
signaling cascade or contributing to several responses simultaneously.
They are involved in a variety processes such as chemotaxis,
osmoregulation, magnesium transport, pH tolerance, sporulation, or
response of virulent species to host cell&apos;s environments.</description>
