<attribute name="description" value="Viral protein involved in host immune evasion thereby optimizing viralgrowth and dissemination. Viral immune evasion strategies are typicalof viruses which persist in their host throughout life. For example:Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae and Retroviridae havedeveloped subversions of the MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway.In order to reduce the effectiveness of cytotoxic T-lymphocytesimmunity, they express proteins that either down-modulate MHC class Iexpression (degradation or mislocalization) or interfere with theantigen binding/presentation process (down-regulation of the expressionof the transporter associated with antigen processing TAP). Someproteins of these virus families also down-regulate other moleculesinvolved in immune recognition."/>

<attribute name="description" value="Protein which, if defective, causes a congenital disorder ofglycosilation. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes, N-linked glycans are first assembled on the lipid carrier dolichylpyrophosphate. The GlcNAc(2)Man(9)Glc(3) oligosaccharide istransferred to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides.Defects along the biosynthetic pathway of N-glycans are associatedwith severe multisystemic syndromes called congenital disorders ofglycosylation (CDG). The characteristic biochemical feature of CDG isdefective glycosylation of glycoproteins due to mutations in genesrequired for the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. Defects ofthe assembly of dolichyl-linked oligosaccharides or their transfer onto nascent glycoproteins form type I forms of CDG, whereas CDG type IIcomprises all defects of the trimming and elongation of N-linkedoligosaccharides."/>
